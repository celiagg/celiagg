Welcome to celiagg's documentation!
===================================

celiagg is a Cython wrapper of the popular
`Anti-Grain Geometry library  <http://www.antigrain.com>`_ which
supports Python 3 (3.5+).

Keeping with the tradition of AGG, celiagg aims to have a minimal number of
dependencies. Currently only `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ is a required
dependency, although the `freetype 2.6 <https://www.freetype.org/>`_ library is
an optional dependency if you don't want to draw text.
